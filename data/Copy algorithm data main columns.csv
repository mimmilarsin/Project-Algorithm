Teachers as intellectuals produce knowledge through research on their practice and other fields of knowledge, learn on how to disseminate such knowledge and understanding its consequences. As citizens, teachers use their own and their students’ experiences and knowledge of needs of their community/society to play an activist role in transforming society.

Despite this, surprisingly few studies have addressed the potential impacts of noise in a marine animal husbandry setting. In this regard, the behaviour of fish in public aquariums can be used as an indicator of well-being, and noise is known to cause behavioural changes. This case study investigates the behaviour of cod (Gadus morhua) and saithe (Pollachius virens) in a large public aquarium when exposed to increased noise levels originating from an aquarium renovation carried out by construction divers. Swimming behaviour, group formation and vertical distribution, along with yawning and scratching frequencies of the fish, were analysed from video recordings made before, during and after the exposure to increased noise levels. The same parameters were also analysed to evaluate potential effects of the presence of divers when not making renovation noise, compared to fish behaviour prior to the renovation. There was a slight change in the depth distribution of both species and a decrease in the number of scratches in cod due to the presence of divers that were not making renovation noise. In the presence of construction noises in the tank, however, both cod and saithe showed a wider array of behavioural changes, including increased swimming speed, changes in depth distribution and increased yawning frequencies. The results from this case study demonstrate that an underwater renovation with increased noise levels impacts fish behaviour and suggests that underwater noise should be considered during the management of aquatic environments, including public aquaria.</p>",,,,,,,,,,,,,2023-08-29,2023-08-29,2024-02-01,https://hb.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1792248/FULLTEXT01.pdf,,6,,deprecated,,,,,,TRUE,TRUE,Verkets författare anser att innehållet i publikationen faller inom ämnet hållbar utveckling.,

Clinicians working in the emergency medical services (EMS) encounter numerous situations in various conditions, and to be able to provide efficient and patient safe care they need to understand what is going on and possible projections of the current situation. The design of this study encompassed a Goal-Directed Task analysis where situation awareness information requirements were mapped in relation to goals related to various aspects of the EMS mission. A group of 30 EMS subject matter experts were recruited and answered a web-based survey in three rounds related to what they though themselves or a colleague might need to achieve situation awareness related to the specific goals of various situations. The answers were analysed using content analysis and descriptive statistics. Answers reached consensus at a predetermined level of 75%. Those who reached consensus were entered into the final goal-directed task analysis protocol. The findings presented that EMS clinicians must rely on their own, or their colleagues prior experience or knowledge to achieve situation awareness. This suggests that individual expertise plays a crucial role in developing situation awareness. There also seems to be limited support for situation awareness from organizational guidelines. Furthermore, achieving situation awareness also involves collaborative efforts from the individuals involved in the situation.

Discourses on academic career are often expressing meritocracy and the necessity of competition, but also include demands for flexibil-ity and global participation. Recent decades of higher education policy have also stressed the importance of gender equity, which is particularly evident in the Nordic countries. Yet, how these discourses interact and impact on contemporary ideas on academic career remains unclear. We analyse a selection of Swedish government bills to explore present policy discourses on academic career mobility, and how these discourses express and create tensions for different staff groups. The findings shows that the notion, and promotion of career mobility in Swedish higher education features tensions between career advancement, transnational mobility and work life stability. It is also clear that some scholars are defined as more career mobile and successful than others. Hence, discourses on career mobility tend to give legitimacy to already existing work divisions and hierarchies partly undermining gender equity. In conclusion, our findings show tensions and contradictions in these policies, which give base for further nuanced and critical discussions on the current conditions and possibilities in Swedish higher education and academic career.</p>",,,,,,,,,,,,,2023-07-18,2023-07-18,2024-02-01,https://hb.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1783029/FULLTEXT01.pdf,,2,,deprecated,,,,,,TRUE,,Verkets författare anser att innehållet i publikationen faller inom ämnet hållbar utveckling.,

The results show that geographical locations, wind power functions and small wind turbines comprise the most prominent subthemes of the search queries. This is replicated also in the search term frequencies, providing further insights to queries related to wind turbine’s efficiency as well as subthemes of advantages and disadvantages.

The empirical material has been analyzed from the perspective of mediated discourse analysis (MDA). The result shows how the research circles come to constitute an epistemological development, a change of perspectives among the lead teachers. The result also shows how the research circles generate experience of autonomy.

Despite this, salinity conditions can pose physiological barriers to their spread, and understanding them is important for management. In Scandinavia's largest cargo port, the invasive round goby (Neogobius melanostomus) is established across a steep salinity gradient. We used 12,937 SNPs to identify the genetic origin and diversity of three sites along the salinity gradient and round goby from western, central and northern Baltic Sea, as well as north European rivers. Fish from two sites from the extreme ends of the gradient were also acclimated to freshwater and seawater, and tested for respiratory and osmoregulatory physiology. Fish from the high-salinity environment in the outer port showed higher genetic diversity, and closer relatedness to the other regions, compared to fish from lower salinity upstream the river. Fish from the high-salinity site also had higher maximum metabolic rate, fewer blood cells and lower blood Ca2+. Despite these genotypic and phenotypic differences, salinity acclimation affected fish from both sites in the same way: seawater increased the blood osmolality and Na+ levels, and freshwater increased the levels of the stress hormone cortisol. Our results show genotypic and phenotypic differences over short spatial scales across this steep salinity gradient. These patterns of the physiologically robust round goby are likely driven by multiple introductions into the high-salinity site, and a process of sorting, likely based on behaviour or selection, along the gradient. This euryhaline fish risks spreading from this area, and seascape genomics and phenotypic characterization can inform management strategies even within an area as small as a coastal harbour inlet. </p>",,,,,,,,,,,,,2022-08-12,2022-08-12,2024-01-16,https://hb.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1686931/FULLTEXT01.pdf,Forskningsrådet Formas;Vetenskapsrådet [621-2011-4004];Vetenskapsrådet [621-2016-0334],11,,deprecated,,,,,,TRUE,TRUE,Verkets författare anser att innehållet i publikationen faller inom ämnet hållbar utveckling.,

It draws on concepts from the field of agnotology to explore how environmental ignorances, and specifically related to the climate crisis, are shaped at the intersection of the logics of Google Search, everyday life and civil society/politics. Ignorance refers to a multi-facetted understanding of the culturally contingent ways in which something may not be known. Two research questions are addressed: How are environmental ignorances, and in particular related to the climate crisis, shaped at the intersection of the logics of Google Search, everyday life and civil society/politics? In what ways can we conceptualise Google's role as configured into the creation of ignorances? The argument is made through four vignettes, each of which explores and illustrates how Google Search is configured into a different kind of socially produced ignorance: (1) Ignorance through information avoidance: climate anxiety; (2) Ignorance through selective choice: gaming search terms; (3) Ignorance by design: algorithmically embodied emissions; (4) Ignorance through query suggestions: directing people to data voids. The article shows that while Google Search and its underlying algorithmic and commercial logic pre-figure these ignorances, they are also co-created and co-maintained by content producers, users and other human and non-human actors, as Google Search has become integral of social practices and ideas about them. The conclusion draws attention to a new logic of ignorance that is emerging in conjunction with a new knowledge logic. </p>",,,,,,,,,,,,,2023-02-23,2023-02-23,2024-04-30,https://hb.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1738950/FULLTEXT01.pdf,Mistra - Stiftelsen för miljöstrategisk forskning [MISTRA Environmental Communication],2,,deprecated,,,,,"2,05E+14",TRUE,TRUE,Verkets författare anser att innehållet i publikationen faller inom ämnet hållbar utveckling.,

A prerequisite for our analysis is an understanding of neoliberalism as both denoting a more limited set of concrete principles for the organization of society (the narrow interpretation) or as a hegemonic ideology (the broad interpretation). This conceptual framework, as well as brief history of evaluative bibliometrics, provides an analytical framing for our approach, in which four national research evaluation systems are compared: Norway, Russia, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. On basis of an analysis of the rationales for implementing these systems, as well as their specific design, we discuss the existence or non-existence of neoliberal motivations and rationales. Overall, we find that a relatively homogeneous academic landscape, with a high degree of centralization and government steering, appears to be a common feature for countries implementing national evaluation systems relying on bibliometrics. Such characteristics, we argue, may not be inductively understood as neoliberal but as indications of national states displaying strong political steering of its research system. Consequently, if used without further clarification, ‘neoliberalism’ is a concept too broad and diluted to be useful when analyzing the development of research evaluation and bibliometric measures in the past half a century.</p>",,,,,,,,,,,,,2023-03-21,2023-03-21,2023-03-30,https://hb.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1744956/FULLTEXT01.pdf,,2,,deprecated,,,,,"5,39E+13",TRUE,TRUE,,

We find that the Nordic countries are responsible for a stable share of international publications in health economics. The topics that Nordic health economists publish on are relatively similar to those most prevalent in the international community, even though health insurance is remarkably absent as a research topic in Nordic countries.

Home care services for older persons can be challenging concerning the nature of the interpersonal interaction and communication needed to care for and respond to the diverse needs of older people who seek to live well in our communities. This implies a need to offer more person-centred care (PCC) to older persons. However, there is a lack of knowledge on how to develop such competence. We, therefore, developed A Person-centred CommunicaTION (ACTION) programme, which is a web-based educational intervention aimed at supporting competence development for nursing assistants. The research objective is to evaluate the ACTION programme with respect to participants’ responses to and the effect of the intervention. Methods: A multicentre case–control study with pre- and post-assessments was designed. The ACTION programme will be implemented at home care units, in two different geographic areas in Sweden. A total of 300 nursing assistants will be recruited: 150 for the intervention group and 150 for the control group. We will evaluate the impact measures and the process. Pre- and post-assessments will be performed with data collected via a) audio recordings of communication, b) a questionnaire on self-efficacy communication skills, PCC, empathy and job satisfaction, c) user data, evaluation forms, field notes and observations, and d) interviews. The data will be analysed with descriptive and analytic statistics and/or qualitative methods for meanings. Discussion: This study has the potential to contribute to the evidence supporting competence development required to offer person-centred and quality home care to older persons and to meet upcoming needs for flexible and easily accessible competence development.

We used the sand goby (<em>Pomatoschistus minutus</em>) to test whether sperm performance differed between breeding-coloured males (small testes, large mucus-filled sperm-duct glands; build nests lined with sperm-containing mucus, provide care) and parasitic sneaker-morph males (no breeding colouration, large testes, rudimentary sperm-duct glands; no nest, no care). We compared motility (per cent motile sperm), velocity, longevity of sperm, gene expression of testes and sperm morphometrics between the two morphs. We also tested if sperm-duct gland contents affected sperm performance. We found a clear difference in gene expression of testes between the male morphs with 109 transcripts differentially expressed between the morphs. Notably, several mucin genes were upregulated in breeding-coloured males and two ATP-related genes were upregulated in sneaker-morph males. There was a partial evidence of higher sperm velocity in sneaker-morph males, but no difference in sperm motility. Presence of sperm-duct gland contents significantly increased sperm velocity, and nonsignificantly tended to increase sperm motility, but equally so for the two morphs. The sand goby has remarkably long-lived sperm, with only small or no decline in motility and velocity over time (5 min vs. 22 h), but again, this was equally true for both morphs. Sperm length (head, flagella, total and flagella-to-head ratio) did not differ between morphs and did not correlate with sperm velocity for either morph. Thus, other than a clear difference in testes gene expression, we found only modest differences between the two male morphs, confirming previous findings that increased sperm performance as an adaptation to sperm competition is not a primary target of evolution. </p>",,,,,,,,,,,,,2022-08-12,2022-08-12,2024-02-01,https://hb.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1686935/FULLTEXT01.pdf,Finlands Akademi [136464];Forskningsrådet Formas [217-2008-1719];Vetenskapsrådet [2016-03343];Vetenskapsrådet [621-2011-4004],8,,deprecated,,,,,,TRUE,TRUE,,

The replacement of sociological perspectives by cognitive viewpoints as constituting knowledge is also noted. It is concluded that changes in the political rationality had consequences for how the individual reader was construed, from a subject with the potential to change society to a subject who had to adjust to society.

Explanations of instances consist of two parts; the predicted label with an associated certainty and a set of weights, one per feature, describing how each feature contributes to the prediction for the particular instance. In techniques like Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME), the probability estimate from the underlying model is used as a measurement of certainty; consequently, the feature weights represent how each feature contributes to the probability estimate. It is, however, well-known that probability estimates from classifiers are often poorly calibrated, i.e., the probability estimates do not correspond to the actual probabilities of being correct. With this in mind, explanations from techniques like LIME risk becoming misleading since the feature weights will only describe how each feature contributes to the possibly inaccurate probability estimate. This paper investigates the impact of calibrating predictive models before applying LIME. The study includes 25 benchmark data sets, using Random forest and Extreme Gradient Boosting (xGBoost) as learners and Venn-Abers and Platt scaling as calibration methods. Results from the study show that explanations of better calibrated models are themselves better calibrated, with ECE and log loss for the explanations after calibration becoming more conformed to the model ECE and log loss. The conclusion is that calibration makes the models and the explanations better by accurately representing reality. </p>",,,,,,,,,,,,,2023-08-14,2023-08-14,2024-02-01,https://hb.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1787663/FULLTEXT01.pdf,,4,,deprecated,,,,,,TRUE,TRUE,,

We compare future visions in data feminist material with policies by the European Commission and explore what tensions arise among them. Furthermore, we explore and delineate social and political alternatives that emerge from data feminist texts. Both corpora describe futures inclusive of big data and imagine possible positive outcomes from different perspectives and with different ideas of the current role of big data. We found that sociotechnical imaginaries of big data within the data feminist corpus are considerably richer and more nuanced than those of the European Commission. In the data feminist corpus, big data is described as a multiplicity of things and often implicated in perpetuating power imbalances and large societal issues.

For the conceptual analysis, coding was applied to formulate and abstract four typologies for understanding local information with specific focus on the Thai cultural heritage setting. Findings: The four different typologies include local information as an array of different interpretations as diverse meanings of local, local information as cultural heritage, local information as subject of information management and situated local information. Research limitations/implications: This study mainly focuses relevant typologies for understanding local information in the Thai context. Originality/value: This study contributes and extends the literature in the local information field and the cultural heritage context. In addition, an eclectic strategy of using several alternative typologies for dealing with essentially contested concepts is suggested.

Thailand’s provincial universities have the national responsibility of digitising LI, enforced through the Provincial University Library Network’s (PULINET’s) Local Information Working Group (LIWG). The aim of this study is to explore how the LIWG’s digitisation activities contribute to the shaping of LI as national concern and resource. Empirical data come from interviews with 23 LIWG professionals in 2016–2017. A qualitative content analysis is performed within an overall activity theory framework with emphasis on <em>overt </em>and <em>unobtrosive </em>manifestations of <em>contradictions</em> through a combination of Engeström’s and Blackler’s typologies. The results show that <em>primary contradictions</em> exist in the form of incompatible conceptions of LI between individual group members and the group’s consensus-oriented LI definition. <em>Secondary contradictions</em> emerge as incongruences between group members’ general conceptions of LI, and specific digitisation activities of the LIWG. In general, LI is conceptualised as dynamic, situated, collective, culture-nature integrated resources with strong applied-use value, in line with international ILK definitions and agendas. The actual LIWG activities, however, circumscribe this conception through a restricted focus on formal regional delimitations; prominent objects; societally desirable expressions; and an academic/research framing. Overall, the findings illustrate that the LIWG’s activities contribute to shape LI as a tool for national social and cultural unity that exclude marginalised groups and societally undesirable LI expressions. In these activities, the primary and secondary types of contradictions are hidden and counteracted, rather than used as constructive opportunities for learning, change, and development. The study provides a unique, internationally framed, perspective on LI and related digitisation activities in Thailand. Methodologically, the study is case specific, limited to a cross-section in time and to data from interview accounts of LIWG members.</p>",,,,,,,,,,,,,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,2024-01-16,,,2,,deprecated,,,,,,TRUE,TRUE,,

At the same time, society demands the digitalization of preschool practice, which has caused concern not only about negative effects on children’s well-being but also the risk of foregrounding digital over analog tools in multidimensional and child-centered preschool practice. The aim of this study is to analyze how preschool teachers at the forefront of digitalization integrate digital and analog tools when teaching science and how this integration affects their practice. The data comprises documentation of digitalized science activities provided by ten preschool teachers and transcribed recall interviews with four of the teachers. Thematic content analysis and a framework for analyzing seven teaching dimensions of preschool science revealed the use of digital and analog tools as drivers for multidimensional science education. The findings show that the teachers primarily use digital tools to reinforce social learning, inclusion, and agency during science activities. Digital and analog tools were used to complement one another in pursuing the boundaries of multidimensional science. However, the content of this innovative and digitalized science teaching remained primarily within biology, the traditional scholarly discipline in preschool science. We conclude that the digitalization of preschool science seems to be used to strengthen and diversify teaching within the boundaries of overarching traditional preschool practice where nature encounters and children’s interests and well-being are at the forefront.  </p>",,,,,,,,,,,,,2023-10-31,2023-10-31,2024-02-01,https://hb.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1808402/FULLTEXT01.pdf,Örebro universitet,3,,deprecated,,,,,,TRUE,TRUE,,

Given that many of the concerns articulated in recent reform movements go back decades, why has momentum for change grown only in the past 10 years? In this paper, we draw on analytical insights from the sociology of social movements on <em>collective action frames</em> to chart the emergence, development, and expansion of “responsible metrics” as a <em>professional reform movement</em>. Through reviewing important texts that have shaped reform efforts, we argue that hitherto, three framings have underpinned the responsible metrics reform agenda: the <em>metrics skepticism</em> framing, the <em>professional-expert</em> framing, and the <em>reflexivity</em> framing. We suggest that although these three framings have coexisted within the responsible metrics movement to date, cohabitation between these framings may not last indefinitely, especially as the responsible metrics movement extends into wider research assessment reform movements. </p>",,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-03-11,2024-03-11,2024-10-01,,,2,,deprecated,,,,,,TRUE,TRUE,,

Thus, two GDA approaches, the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and the Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA), as well as analyses of co-citation and co-authorship relations, were used to identify the positions of these journals in the field. One key finding is the historical shift from an earlier dominance of chemistry-related journals to publications more broadly concerned with sustainability research. The MCA analyses show that the selection of research topics is in line with a “weak” rather than “strong” interpretation of the concept “sustainability.” Networks based on co-authorship relations reveal an overall increment in this type of collaboration, both at the level of organizations and countries. Since 2008, Chinese universities have notably increased their presence in the output of the journals examined in the study. Three strategies in shaping the field through its journals are discernable: publications strongly characterized by a systems theory perspective, notably Sustainability Science; generalist journals committed to sustainability research in a broader meaning; and publications that address sustainability issues mainly within a specific discipline. </p>",,,,,,,,,,,,,2023-12-04,2023-12-04,2024-02-01,https://hb.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1816607/FULLTEXT01.pdf,,1,,deprecated,,,,,,TRUE,TRUE,,

Complete assortative mating was observed among all sympatric species. Parapatric species with similar depth habitat distributions interbred whereas other parapatric and allopatric species showed complete assortative mating. F1 hybrids mated exclusively with species accepted by females of the parental species. The existence of complete assortative mating among some currently allopatric species suggests that pre-existing mating barriers could be sufficient to explain current patterns of co-existence, although, of course, many other factors may be involved. Regardless of the mechanism, mating preferences may influence species distribution in potentially hybridizing taxa, such as in the adaptive radiation of cichlid fish. We suggest that this at least partly explains why some species fail to establish breeding populations in locations where they are occasionally recorded.

Translanguaging practicesFootnote1 were identified and analyzed from a sociocultural perspective. Benito, the newcomer, spontaneously used English, Swedish, Spanish and Portuguese and prior knowledge in creative ways in interactions with his classmate during pair work, something that was not possible in whole class instruction. Multilingual peer dialogue, multilingual private speech and the use of multilingual artifacts increased learning opportunities. Moreover, Benito and his classmate Edin engaged in exploratory talk and demonstrated metalinguistic awareness. This study indicates that teachers who actively facilitate the use of students' multiple linguistic resources for sensemaking can contribute to a more egalitarian education and increase opportunities for learning in linguistically diverse classrooms.</p>",,,,,,,,,,,,,2023-05-15,2023-05-15,2024-02-01,https://hb.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1757116/FULLTEXT01.pdf,,2,,deprecated,,,,,,TRUE,TRUE,Verkets författare anser att innehållet i publikationen faller inom ämnet hållbar utveckling.,

Lärarna legitimerar sin skolas organisation (eller brist på organisation) genom moralisk värdering med hänvisning till elevernas behov. Eftersom lärarna uttrycker sig som experter på vad nyanlända behöver, och hur deras behov kan tillgodoses, klassificeras denna legitimering också som personlig auktorisation. De lärare som arbetar i skolor som har en organiserad undervisning i grundläggande sva uttrycker i högre grad att nyanlända behöver systematiskt stöd i sin grundläggande andraspråksutveckling (diskursen separering med fokus på grundläggande andraspråksutveckling).

The format accordingly impacts how many contemporary readers use and experience literature. The article examines this tendency, departing from Rita Felski’s theoretical conceptualizations of uses of literature (Felski 2008). Felski represents a new attention within literary studies toward the ways in which so-called lay readers use, experience and form attachments (Felski 2020) to literature and art. Drawing on Felski’s work in combination with Lutz Koepnick’s concept of resonant reading (2019), we study how the medial affordances of the audiobook impact uses of literature among empirical Swedish readers. In this way, we combine the theoretical perspective introduced by Felski with an approach informed by literary sociology (Svedjedal, Murray), in order to draw attention to the importance of considering the significance of media and formats in broader discussions about uses of literature. The article is based on a survey of 1400 Swedish audiobook users, which was published during the fall of 2021, in the Facebook-group Snacka om ljudböcker. We focus on a qualitative analysis of answers to the free-text question “Why do you choose to listen to audiobooks?” Our findings demonstrate that the medial affordances of the audiobook, its mobility and the mediation of literature through sound, impact both why and how readers listen to audiobooks: Respondents report among other things that audiobooks make it possible to integrate literature into everyday life, and that, consequently, it adds value to everyday activities, while the format’s mediation though sound, and especially the voice of the performer “adds a dimension” and “deepens” the reading experience. Thus, while the existing debate often associates audiobooks with distracted or passive reading and, in Felski’s terms, with detachment from the surroundings, and from the text, our findings suggest that the format also helps readers form attachments to and through literature. </p>",,,,,,,,,,,,,2023-01-13,2023-01-13,2023-01-16,https://hb.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1726784/FULLTEXT01.pdf,,2,,deprecated,,,,,,SANT,SANT,,

The study draws on ethnographical methods to collect empirical material using video recording, field notes, and small interviews with children. The documentation includes both individual and collaborative reading of digital narratives. Discussed in the intersection between envisionment and affect, the results show that e-book activities create multiple and differing processes of reading. The metacognitive processes initiated by the teacher's instruction of reading strategies create a distance between the student and the text, while processes of embodied sense-making create a closeness to the text that seems to be vital when the students encounter digital narratives and text worlds.

This applies also to the diversity of values and worldviews in Swedish early childhood education and care (ECEC). Still, in the increasingly secular contexts, societal hegemony often fails to include children's home religions and worldviews in the actions and understandings aiming towards inclusiveness. We argue that it is of critical importance to also include the plurality of worldviews in the educational perception of ""the whole child"" in the care and education taking place in ECEC. The purpose of this article is to connect the discussions in the fields of intercultural and interreligious education, in particular those dealing with the diversity of religions and worldviews, to discussions on care and social sustainability in ECEC. The UN Agenda 2030 for Sustainable Development promotes inclusive and equitable education, and the Convention on the Rights of the Child states children's right to freedom of religion and a concern for the spiritual, moral, and social development. Our previous findings have illustrated the importance of religions and worldviews in the intercultural work within early childhood education, both empirically and conceptually, and as part of the moral core of teaching. This article employs feminist and postcolonial ethics of care as a theoretical lens in elaborating on the three key notions: social sustainability, care, and worldviews. Several discursive challenges that ECEC teachers in Sweden face in their work, to enhance social sustainability by supporting the child's well-being and sense of belonging in the ECEC, have been outlined. To conclude, we bring forth a theoretical and analytical tool for the understanding, researching, and planning of socially sustainable communities of care.</p>",,,,,,,,,,,,,2022-04-20,2022-04-20,2024-02-01,https://hb.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1652760/FULLTEXT01.pdf,,3,,deprecated,,,,,,FALSKT,SANT,,

To explore the nature of CR and influencing factors in this context, an inductive case study examined 34 observed patient–RN encounters in an EMS setting focusing on ambulance care. The results reveal a fragmented CR approach involving several parallel decision-making processes grounded in and led by patients’ narratives.

In this conceptual article, we discuss how these academic social networking sites, as devices of evaluation that build on both traditional values, objects, and metrics in academic publishing and on social media logics and algorithmic metrics, come to fulfil a need in the current academic (publishing) ecosystem. We approach this issue by identifying key affordances that arise in the interaction between platform and user. We then position these affordances in relation to potential needs of academics in today’s publishing landscape by drawing on Hafermalz’s metaphor of the ‘fear of exile’, which provides an alternative way of understanding the importance of visibility in the networked world, as a combination of competitive exposure and existential recognition. We end by considering the grounds on which the platforms may be attributed some level of legitimacy. This is done in order to understand the inherent contradiction between the broad use of the platforms and the fact that their integrity has been questioned repeatedly. We seek an answer to a legitimacy for the platforms in the fact that a pragmatic, mutual benefit exists between them and the research community; a benefit that is enhanced by the audit society influencing current academia. </p>",,,,,,,,,,,,,2023-03-21,2023-03-21,2024-02-01,https://hb.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1744970/FULLTEXT01.pdf,,2,,deprecated,,,,,,SANT,SANT,,

The action-based methodological framework takes a starting point in John Dewey's pragmatism, transactions and functions of education including qualification, socialization and person-formation. Two analytical approaches; Practical Epistemology Analysis (PEA) and Epistemological Move Analysis (EMA) are used to clarify and illustrate individual, social and institutional dimensions of learning from four sequences of one preschool activity including four children and one teacher talking about a fairy tale.

The conclusion is that the Folk High School environment and the educational courses can contribute to an increased sense of well-being in the present. The liberating process primarily impacts the participants’ self-stigma positively as long as this takes place in environments where the participants have experience of not being exposed to social stigma, either at home or at the Folk High School.

Over two weeks, males fed in excess were fed daily, whereas food-deprived males were fed once a week. Females only spawned with males that produced courtship sound. However, there were no treatment effects on the occurrence of spawning and males fed in excess did not invest more in visual or acoustic courtship than food-deprived males. That said, males fed in excess built more well-covered nests, with more sand piled on top, compared to food-deprived males. Male condition measured as lipid content differed significantly between treatments. However, only males fed in excess differed in lipid content from wild caught males, indicating that in nature, males are of similar condition to males in the low condition treatment group. Apart from the importance of courtship sound, the only male or female behaviour predicting reproductive success was if male displayed in the nest opening. Males often produce courtship sounds together with a visual display in this position. A female dark-eye display did not associate with reproductive success which, together with previous results, suggest a non-ornamental function of this trait.

Our article offers examples of school librarian practices that deal with issues of sexuality and gender conceptualized in their work with LGBTQ+ literature from a norm critical perspective. We analysed semi-structured interviews with eight librarians in four secondary and upper secondary schools through the lens of the theory of practice architectures (Kemmis &amp; Grootenboer, 2008). Our findings demonstrate how the norm critical practices of school librarians are enabled and constrained by arrangements within the school site, as well as by management, colleagues and professional learning practices. The projects carried out by school librarians that employ norm critical perspectives are both strengthened and challenged by collaboration with principals and other education professionals at the school site. When teachers challenge the views of librarians, the latter have to re-think and re-negotiate normative positions. Hence, norm critical thinking is not only taught but also practiced in the everyday work in school libraries.

The social democratic reforms from the 1940s that aimed to create a centralised, expanded and integrated comprehensive education system came to an end. Decentralisation, neoliberal governance and the introduction of new public management with the creation of private schools and competition have shaped the policy regime since then. Ethnography emerged in Swedish educational research as a significant research methodology during this transitional period. Using a qualitative and quantitative investigation of research dissertations that classified and counted the use of ethnography as either classical (using core references and long-term participation research at one or a limited number of sites), or adapted (used within adaptations to other research methods), the present article explores these developments at two universities. It suggests that Swedish education ethnography has developed along similar kinds of historical trajectories to ethnography in other places, with roots similar to those in other European countries, though also with some variations. For instance, as elsewhere, ethnography needed a breakthrough point in Swedish education research. It got this in the 1980s. However, it quickly became an important part of educational research from the 1990s onwards and a strong quantitative take off early in the new millennium followed. Presently more than half of all PhD dissertations in Education at the two universities have some kind of participant observation, over half of which are also classically ethnographic. This leads us to conclude that education ethnography in Sweden has changed across its period of growth and that though configured in contemporary social science as having originated in anthropology as a methodology that employed long-term embedded participant observation, this does not limit the variations of ethnography’s development or its application.</p>",,,,,,,,,,,,,2022-07-26,2022-07-26,2024-02-01,https://hb.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1684442/FULLTEXT01.pdf,,2,,deprecated,,,,,,SANT,SANT,,

This study set out to explore the experiences of 30 pre-service teachers when transitioning to digital distance learning. The pre-service teachers (PSTs) participated in a series of focus-group interviews that were subsequently analysed using qualitative content analysis. The results indicate that the transition to digital distance learning worked well and that the technology that was used performed satisfactorily. However, the PSTs experienced both opportunities and obstacles with respect to distance learning. The opportunities associated with digital distance learning were reported to be instantiated by teacher-led ‘flipped classroom’ teaching sessions and the additional freedom that was enjoyed by the PSTs (in both space and time). An obstacle associated with digital learning was the feeling that important aspects of interpersonal interaction disappeared. The PSTs remained sedentary and isolated at home, and the learning experience became somewhat dysfunctional when the teaching was not clearly structured and teacher-lead. The study concludes that it is not possible to replace IRL (‘in real life’) teaching entirely with digital distance learning.

The study is based on interviews with 23 LIWG members, collected in 2016–2017. A guided, qualitative content analysis focused on uncovering themes of digitisation tools and methods with Third Space relevance as supporting or hindering <em>essentialism</em>, <em>fixity </em>and <em>hybridity </em>in LI representations. The findings illustrate that whereas the digitisation itself, field studies, language choices and outreach activities offer certain Third Space potential, this is underdeveloped and largely circumstantial. Third Space potentials are further likely to be restricted or hindered by uneven distribution of internet access, digital literacy, standard Thai proficiency and university/academic library accessibility among the Thai public in general and LI holders in particular. Overall, marginalised groups are excluded, and LI holders are positioned as passive contributors and recipients of digitised LI, suggesting a reversed sort of ‘self-essentialism’ on behalf of the dominant culture. In conclusion, two aspects in particular require further attention for libraries engaging with digitisation of ILK types of resources: the inclusion of national, societal level participation into participatory approaches; and the incorporation of functionalities for user interaction, holistic knowledge representation, multiple languages and cultural protocols into ICT for representation and use.

The article has revealed the existence of different logics of participation. These logics include discourses and practices closer to democratic models of participation in schools in remote areas, participation models based on customer acquisition in more accessible schools, and models corresponding to a bureaucratic perspective on participation in some other places. The discourses seem to correspond to the interactions that take place inside and outside each of the spaces as an expression of their different logics of survival in the context of the market. </p>",,,,,,,,,,,,,2023-11-22,2023-11-22,2024-02-01,https://hb.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1814011/FULLTEXT01.pdf,,2,,deprecated,,,,,,SANT,SANT,,

Altogether, the multimodal demands of science can be challenging, in particular for students learning the language of instruction in parallel with the subject content. Yet, multimodal perspectives are scarce in research concerning science learning in linguistically diverse classrooms, where several students are educated in their second language. Drawing on designs for learning theory, the interaction in a linguistically diverse physics classroom was analyzed through the Learning Design Sequence model to investigate the teacher’s design for learning for students’ meaning-making about ‘sound’. Thereto, students’ ‘signs of learning’ regarding subject content and how to communicate content in line with the discourse of science was analyzed. The teacher’s design for learning gave the students opportunities to interact about content by use of different semiotic modes, with gradually higher demands regarding both content and how to express the content which appeared to support students’ development of content knowledge and competency to express this knowledge in line with the discourse of science. However, some of the teacher’s choices appeared to be a hindrance for the students. </p>",,,,,,,,,,,,,2022-09-30,2022-09-30,2022-11-04,https://hb.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1700379/FULLTEXT01.pdf,Vetenskapsrådet [2013-42867-99966-13],2,,deprecated,,,,,662,SANT,SANT,Verkets författare anser att innehållet i publikationen faller inom ämnet hållbar utveckling.,

With regard to our theoretical foundations, our study builds on the work of authors such as Campos (2009), Marques et al. (2020), Nóvoa (1999, 2017, 2019) and Zwierewicz et al. (2020). Methodologically, it is based on bibliographic review with a qualitative approach.

A quantitative search for 14 chosen keywords preceded a closer analysis of the concepts <em>*language*</em> and <em>*cultur*</em>, when using truncation, in 192 syllabi. This showed that linguistic diversity was to a certain extent evident, mainly through the subjects Swedish and English, while for one university cultural diversity was mainly identified in the syllabi of Educational Work and English. If knowledge about linguistic and cultural diversity is limited to language subjects, and to some extent to pre-school and earlier school years, the risk is high that student teachers are not prepared to support equity in education for multilingual and non-dominant groups. Thus, we find that students studying the current Swedish teacher education programme are unlikely to be well equipped to meet the challenges related to creating equal educational opportunities for students in situations of linguistic and cultural diversity. </p>",,,,,,,,,,,,,2022-12-12,2022-01-28,2023-01-17,https://hb.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1718057/FULLTEXT01.pdf,,4,,deprecated,,,,,,SANT,SANT,,

In addition to a general analysis of the respective courses, a questionnaire was applied to 76 professors and 926 students from the mentioned courses. The pattern of use is analyzed by means of classification of tools in four groups; distribution tools, communication tools, interaction tools, and course management tools. The results confirm that LMS is widely utilized to distribute documents to students, while the tools facilitating interaction and collaboration are used sparingly and this pattern is consistent over time. Despite an increase in the total use of LMS, there is no increase in the use of digital tools for interaction in Higher Education, which indicates the importance of promoting a wide use of collaborative methods and of encouraging interaction.</p>",,,,,,,,,,,,,2022-04-08,2022-04-08,2022-04-11,https://hb.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1650837/FULLTEXT01.pdf,,6,,deprecated,,,,,,SANT,SANT,,

In the latter case, the profiles' (re)presentations of researchers may be used to assess whether a researcher can be trusted. The article introduces a conceptual framework of how trust in researchers may be formed based on how the researchers' experiences and achievements are mobilized on the profiles to tell a multifaceted story of the “self.” Design/methodology/approach: The framework is an analytical product which draws on theories of trust as well as on previous research focused on academic web profiles and on researchers' perceptions of trust and credibility. Two dimensions of trust are identified as central to the theoretical construction of trust, namely competence and trustworthiness. Findings: The framework outlines features of profile content and narrative that may influence the assessment of the profile and of the researcher's competence and trustworthiness. The assessment is understood as shaped by the frames of interpretation available to a particular audience. Originality/value: The framework addresses the lack of a trust perspective in previous research about academic web profiles. It provides an analysis of how potential trust in the researcher may be formed on the profiles. An innovative contribution is the acknowledgement of both qualitative and quantitative indicators of trustworthiness and competence, including the richness of the story told about the “self”. </p>",,,,,,,,,,,,,2021-10-01,2021-10-01,2022-01-05,https://hb.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1599581/FULLTEXT01.pdf,,1,,deprecated,,,,,,FALSKT,SANT,,
