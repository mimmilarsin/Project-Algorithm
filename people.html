            <h2>Mimmi Larsin, 29</h2>
            <h3>Gothenburg</h3>
            <p>Given my background in web development and my studies in the Web Editor program at the University of Borås, 
                I felt confident taking on the responsibility of developing the website for this project. I have created 
                several websites in the past, which made it a natural choice for me to lead this part of the project.
                I created a project and repository on GitHub, where I designed and built the four 
                pages of the website. Additionally, I crafted the CSS code and integrated images to ensure a visually 
                appealing layout. My goal was to create an engaging platform that effectively showcases our project's data 
                and findings.</p>

            <h3>Falun</h3>
            <p>Since I have worked with cleaning DiVA-data before and have knowledge about the structure of the database, it suited me best to be part of the data curation team.</p>

            <h3>Varberg</h3>
            <p>Guided by Lisa G.´s expertise we cleaned the dataset together, following the requirement set out by our 
                algorithmic master Dani P.<br>
                Following this, I doumented the process of the cleaning and by the watchful eye of our coding empress, Mimmi 
                L. I followed her outline and added information to the dataset page</p>

            <h2>Daniela Perez</h2>
            <h3>Växjö</h3>
            <p>With my background in Library and Information Science, including experience analyzing bibliometric data, 
                the task of designing the algorithm felt like a balanced blend of familiar territory with enough space to 
                challenge my coding skills. Once pseudocode was written, I programmed the algorithm in R since it's the 
                language I've most recently used for data analysis. But because I love a good puzzle, I challenged myself to 
                learn the basics of python and coded a short script to perform the same tasks.</p>
