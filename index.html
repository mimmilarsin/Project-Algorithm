        <h2>The assignment</h2>
        <p>This assignment involves working in a group to collect and process a dataset, as well as developing an algorithm to 
            analyze the data in a meaningful way. We have created a website that brings our dataset, algorithm, and project 
            details together, showcasing both the data and the steps we’ve taken to work with it. Our team chose to work with 
            data on research collaborations from the DiVA portal, focusing on publications from 2022 and 2023. The website 
            provides insights into our project, from the dataset itself to how we’ve used our algorithm to visualize and 
            analyze collaboration patterns.</p>
