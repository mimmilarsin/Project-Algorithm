        <h2>The Design & Tasks</h2>
        <p>The algorithm was designed to process a data set consisting of research publication records sourced from DiVA
             portal, focusing on author collaborations. The overall goal was to be able to determine the number of authors per 
             publication and then categorize collaborative authorships based on the institutional and national affiliations 
             of each author. Analyses of these collaboration patterns can provide useful insight into the current state of a 
             research network, drawing attention to the range and diversity of collaborators. Further analyses can be 
             performed using this categorical data, including: annual comparisons for a single department or institution, 
             inter-departmental comparisons at the institutional level, and national comparisons within a particular field or 
             discipline, etc.</p>
        <p>For a small data set, assigning categories to each publication record can be done manually without too much of a 
            time commitment. However, as the data set grows, and the level of analysis does as well, it becomes more efficient 
            to automate the process using an algorithm.</p>
        <p>Two primary tasks were identified for our purposes:
            <ol>
                <li>Determine the number of authors</li>
                <li>Determine the collaboration type</li>
            </ol>
            The first task would need to identify the number of authors for a publication, and then categorize the 
            collaboration as either individual, pair, or group. The second task would then compare the affiliations between 
            co-authors, filtering out individually-authored publications, categorizing the collaboration type as either local 
            (within the same institution), national (within the same country), or international (multiple countries). Since 
            authors and their affiliations are located in a single field when sourcing publication records from DiVA portal, a 
            sub-task separating the affiliation details would need to be included before the collaboration type could be 
            determined.
