        <h2>Data? I hardly know her!</h2>
        <p>We chose to collect out data from DiVA, a swedish digital publishing system for research institutes, as it was a database we were all familiar with and some memebers of the group had previous experience in working with their data. 

Through an advanced search we limited our search querie to articles in journals published within the years 2022-2023 through the Faculty of Librarianship, Information, Education and IT from Högskolan i Borås. This gave us a total of 94 results which we exported fully with all the metadata on to a CSV file. 

The goal of our algorithm was to fund out how many authors had worked on one paper, and if the collaborations were local (through the same institution), national (from different institutions in Sweden) or international. .</p>

        <h2>Scruba dub dub</h2>
        <p>In order to achieve our algorithmic goal we had to clean out data accordingly. We chose to focus on the authors names, orcid-id, what institution they work for and in what country. All other information was removed, and the necessary information was structured in a consistent CSV file, demonstrated as follows: 

Lastname, Firstname, orcid, (organisation, country) 

As some authors were affiliated with multiple organisations over multiple countries this was written in parenthesis so the information could be repeated within the same comma. Where information was missing it was replaced with a space to ensure the data would still be read correctly by the algorithm. 

Once the data had been cleaned, we chose to fill in some missing data which mainly consisted of some missing orcid-id's or organisation 

We chose to not remove data from other columns in orer to gice the possibillity of furthering the algorithm and exploring other aspects, such as which journals appear more than once across the articles published. However, since this was not the specific goal for this moment in time, we did not clean the data within those columns.  </p>
